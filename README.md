📘 Java DSA Practice

This repository contains my solutions to Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) problems, implemented in Java.
The goal of this repo is to improve problem-solving skills, maintain consistency, and document my DSA learning journey.


🚀 Topics Covered

🔹 Arrays – Searching, subarrays, rotation, etc.

🔹 Strings – Palindrome, anagram, substring problems.

🔹 Recursion – Factorial, Fibonacci, backtracking, grid paths.

🔹 Sorting Algorithms – Bubble sort, Merge sort, Quick sort, etc.

🔹 Searching Algorithms – Binary search, Linear search.

🔹 Bit Manipulation – Set bits, XOR problems.

🔹 Dynamic Programming (DP) – (Coming soon 🚀).

🔹 Graphs & Trees – (Planned).



📈 Progress

📅 I am committing at least one problem daily to maintain consistency.

✅ August 2025: Started pushing DSA practice codes daily.
✅ Building streaks and improving problem-solving one step at a time!
